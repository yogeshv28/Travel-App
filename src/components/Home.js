        Life is all about experiences. And unlike material things, 
        experiences stay with us no matter where we go. Finding ways to make the most of our 
        life experiences is a challenge that we face every day. As human beings, we like to put a 
        value on the things we pursue. We like to feel that what we are doing has a meaning. 
        This purpose is important to our well-being, as itâ€™s from those experiences in life that we learn and grow. 
        Pursuing what we love brings us invaluable life lessons about ourselves and the world around us!
